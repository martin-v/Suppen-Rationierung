The Suppen Rationierung
=======================

Suppen Rationierung is a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) script
for [soup.io](http://www.soup.io/) to protect you from excessive
procrastination.

Usage
=====

Install greasemonkey or an equivalent for
[other browsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey#Equivalents_for_other_browsers).
Afterwards open with your browser the following URL and allow the installation
of the script:

    https://github.com/martin-v/Suppen-Rationierung/raw/master/suppenrationierung.user.js

Now you can use soup.io without concerns about too much procrastination. If you
want to waste more (or less) time on soup.io, you can configure the ```freeMinutes``` and
the ```closeSpeed``` in the script.
